MokenLand serves as a comprehensive no-code platform within the Mode Ecosystem. Developers can effortlessly create smart contracts that are automatically registered for Sequential Fee Sharing (SFS), ensuring they earn every time their smart contracts are utilized. The ecosystem offers various features, including MokenFactory for deploying custom smart contracts with just a few clicks, MokenGarage for easy editing and management of created tokens, MokenMarket for listing and buying tokens on the Mode Network, and more.

The inspiration behind MokenLand is rooted in the desire to create a no-code Mode Ecosystem that simplifies the process for developers to join and seamlessly create smart contracts on the Mode Network. As a solo developer and a beginner in web3, the goal was to make the adoption of web3, specifically using Mode, more accessible by providing a user-friendly platform for developers.
